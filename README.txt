This script is used for helping with the gaming clip reviewing process. 
After a couple hour recocoring of gameplay it becomes quite annoying to sift 
through that long video recording to find where your kills, or key clips you 
want to extract from the recording might be. This script will help with that 
process by taking you to the exact timestamp in the recording of where the 
kill occured automatically. This is dependent on you knowing that timestamp 
however which I do by utilizing a Stream Deck, and pressing a macro key when a 
kill occurs to spit out that timestamp to a text file of which I will use 
later when I execute this script.
