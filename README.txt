This script is used for helping with the gaming clip reviewing process. After a couple hour recocoring of gameplay it becomes quite annoying to sift thru that long video recording to find where your kills, or key clips you want to extract from the recording might be. This script will help with that process by taking you to the exact timestamp in the recording of where the kill occured automatically. This is dependent on you knowing that timestamp however which I do by utilizing a Steam Deck, and pressing a macro key when a kill occurs to spit out that time stamp to a text file of which I will use later when i execute this script.
